This course talks about Project Management Fundamentals which covers the topics such as Project Management, Roles of Project manager, Projects Life cycle, Project Planning, Methodologies, Risk Management, Affective communication with stakeholders. 
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to meet the project requirement and achieve the desired outcome.

# Project Manager:
First of all it talks about the Project Manager who is responsible for guiding those people who are working in the project and ensuring they have the support they need to complete the project. He isnâ€™t always a direct manager of each member of the project team.
He usually follows a process that involves Planning and organising, managing tasks, Budgeting and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved time frame. 

# Project Life Cycle:
Initiate the project: Define project goal, determine resources, people and other details, get project approval.
Make a plan: Create budget, set schedule, establish team, set roles and responsibility of each person.
 Execute and Complete tasks: Manage the progress, communicate and adjustment 
Close the Project.
 
# Project Planning for Beginners:
A project plan is a useful tool that can be used for any project, big or small. It helps us to document the scope, tasks, milestones, and overall activities of the project. A project plan includes five basic elements: tasks, milestones, people, documentation, and time.
Tasks:  Tasks are activities that need to be completed within a set period of time and are assigned to different members of the team according to their roles and skills.
 Milestones: Milestones are important points within the schedule that indicate progress and usually signify the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.
 People: The people working on the team and their roles are also included in the project plan. It's important that each team member understands their role and the tasks they are responsible for completing.
Documentation: A project plan is a good place to link to relevant documentation which helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals on our team.
 Time estimation: The estimated time that will be spent on the project should also be included in the project plan. The estimated time includes dates on which tasks should be started and completed, the dates when you hope to reach various milestones, and the start and end dates of the project.
 
# Project Management Methodology:
A project management methodology is a framework or set of principles and practices used to plan, execute, and control projects effectively. These methodologies provide guidelines for project teams to follow throughout the project lifecycle, from initiation to completion. Here are some common project management methodologies:
Waterfall:  In the waterfall methodology, projects progress linearly through a sequence of phases, including initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, and changes are difficult to implement once a phase is finished.
Agile: Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. The Agile methodology emphasises delivering small, incremental pieces of functionality rather than attempting to deliver the entire project at once. This is like saying, "Let's build the castle step-by-step, figuring things out as we go. We can change the design if needed and keep making it better!"
Scrum: Scrum is a specific framework within Agile that provides a structured way to implement Agile principles. This is like having a specific set of instructions with different roles (builder, organiser, helpers) and clear steps to follow.
Six Sigma: Six Sigma focuses on improving the quality of processes by identifying and reducing defects and variations. It uses statistical methods and a structured approach (DMAIC: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) to achieve measurable results and customer satisfaction.
 
# Risk Management:
<li>Find the things that might go wrong with the project</li>
Figure out which problems are the most serious
Make a plan to either solve or avoid the big problems
Pay attention to see if any new problems come up
Have a plan for what to do if problems actually happened.
  
# Communicating and working with stakeholders:
Understand who is interested in or affected by the project.
Figure out what each person or group cares about regarding the project.
Share project information in a simple and understandable way.
Pay attention to their thoughts, concerns, and suggestions.
Share project updates regularly to keep everyone in the loop.
Involve them in decisions and activities when it makes sense.
 Address any disagreements or issues calmly and find solutions together that you're reliable and care about their interests.
By effectively communicating and collaborating with stakeholders, you can gain their support, mitigate risks, and increase the chances of project success.
